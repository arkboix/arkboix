üëã Hey, I'm Arkboi!  

I am a LONICKS user ofc, workin on cool stuff thatll prolly only work on my machine

## What I do

"I tinker with config files, break my system regularly, and pretend to be productive."

``` shell
#!/bin/bash
echo "Still a virgin, still using a tiling WM."
```

## Working On

``` shell
if [[ "$came_already" == "true" ]]; then
     echo "Sway Config"
fi


if [[ "$coming_soon" == "true" ]]; then
    echo "Waybar Dock"
fi

if [[ "$cuming_soon" == "true" ]]; then
  echo "Always due to stroking it"
  echo "Figuring out how to make Sway do what I want"
  echo "A Waybar config that isn't scuffed"
  echo "Finally writing a Bash script without Googling"
  echo "Emacs, but only for Org mode (never for actual coding)"
  echo "Realizing I don't need half the aliases I made"
fi


```


## Certified Problems

- rm -rf my system at least once a year
- 100+ aliases, still forget half of them
- Spends hours ricing but barely uses the system
- Constantly swaps terminals like it's a personality trait
- ‚ÄúI'll switch to another WM‚Äù (never happens)
- Emacs user, but only for *one* feature
- ‚ÄúI'll learn C one day‚Äù (no I won‚Äôt)
- Wayland screen sharing? LMAO
- ‚ÄúThis is my final rice.‚Äù (lie)

## Fun facts

- emacs > vim
- whats a visual novel
- dang visual novels are fun
- oh it has hentai in it?
- im playing a visual novel
- it's for the story, I swear
- the soundtrack is fire
- why is this making me emotional
- these 2D girls understand me more than real people
- maybe I should learn Japanese
- *downloads another one*
- 4TB storage is NOT enough
- why are they all calling me "onii-chan" now
- i sleep at 5 AM and regret nothing
- my rice now has an anime girl in the corner
- my terminal greets me with **"„Åä„ÅØ„Çà„ÅÜ„ÄÅ„Åî‰∏ª‰∫∫Êßò"**
- I have ascended past humanity

## Things I Won‚Äôt Admit in Public

- I only opened Emacs once and closed it immediately
- I don‚Äôt know how Wayland screen sharing works, I just pray
- My rice is **95% aesthetic, 5% functional**
- I have over 100 aliases and use like 3
- I told myself I'd stop tweaking my dotfiles (I lied)
- The hentai tag is **"purely for research"**
- My sleep schedule is dictated by **"Just one more chapter"**
- I *may* have bought a dakimakura (but we don‚Äôt talk about that)  

## Random Thoughts at 3AM

- "Maybe I should write my own window manager."
- "What if I tiling WM my tiling WM?"
- "Why does Wayland hate me?"
- "I should try FreeBSD... no, wait, I like suffering, not torture."
- "Why are dotfiles my personality now?"
- "One more VN route, then I sleep." (lie)
- "What if I replace systemd with a 10-line shell script?"


## My daily coping script
```shell
#!/bin/bash
while true; do
  echo "It's not my fault, Linux is just like this."
  echo "I could fix this, but do I really need to?"
  echo "Maybe if I reinstall, it'll work this time."
  sleep 10
done
```
## Future Plans (That Won‚Äôt Happen)

- "Touch grass." (never)
- "Stop tweaking my rice." (impossible)
- "Use a stable system for once." (funny joke)
- "Actually read Emacs documentation."
- "Learn a real programming language, not just Bash."
- "Contribute to open-source instead of just stealing configs."
- "Find a VN that doesn't destroy my sleep schedule."

## Philosophy

- Linux is about freedom (to break my system)
- If it works, I don't trust it
- If I update, I expect something to explode
- If a program isn't in the terminal, do I even need it?
- I use tiling WMs because clicking on windows is for **casuals**
- 2D > 3D
- Real life is temporary, dotfiles are forever

## My Future in AI-generated Bash
```shell
#!/bin/bash
echo "Welcome to Arkboi's Future"
sleep 2
echo "Still running Arch-based Linux, still suffering"
sleep 2
echo "Ricing a terminal that nobody will ever see"
sleep 2
echo "Writing a script to automate something I could do in 2 seconds"
sleep 2
echo "Hitting 'update' knowing something will break"
sleep 2
echo "Contemplating life choices"
sleep 2
echo "Reinstalling everything and calling it 'fresh start'"
```

## Daily Routine

```shell
#!/bin/bash
echo "Wake up"
echo "Open terminal"
echo "Do absolutely nothing productive"
echo "Rice something unnecessary"
echo "Break my setup"
echo "Fix it"
echo "Repeat"
```
