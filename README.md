👋 Hey, I'm Arkboi!  
Just another VRGin Lincox user™ crafting dotfiles, scripting unsanity, and brewing my own programming language.  

⚡ **What I Do**  
- 🖥️ Linux ricer – Archock btw.  
- 🏗️ Making a programming language that reads like plain English.  (will never happen)
- 🎨 Material You colors everywhere (Hyprland, waybar, and beyond).  
- 🔧 DIY dotfiles, because pre-made configs are for normies (like you ofc).  

📂 **Projects I'm Working On**  
- `dotfiles` – My chaotic but *stow-compatible* setup for a perfect Linux rice.  
- `arch-hyprland` - babe, we have Kool's hyprland script at home

🛠️ **Tools & Tech I Use**  
`Archo Linux` | `Hyprland` | `Bash` | `Emacs (Doom)` | `Stow` | `GRUB` | `WebCord` | `Chromium (will turn into flurp)` 

🤖 **Hacking Away At**  
- A better dotfiles update script  
- GRUB bootloader magic for dual-booting Arch distros  
- Custom Material You theming for Linux  

💾 **Random Facts**  
- **$EDITOR** is `emacs sudoedit` because nano is illegal here.  
- `.gitignore?` Never heard of it.  
- QWERTY by day, Dvorak by struggle.  
- I might eat you

🔥 If it's not open source, did it even happen?  

```sh
echo "Stay based, stay free. Stay virgin 🚀"
